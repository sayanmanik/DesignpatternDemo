**OO Principles for Design pattern**

**Strategy Pattern**
- Encapsulation what varies
- Favor composition over Inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations

**Observer Pattern**
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact

**Decoration Pattern**
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
